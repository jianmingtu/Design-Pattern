# Design-Pattern

Abstract Factory:
 From the previous video, I had talked about having two different themes for my GUI, light and dark. For the light theme, the background is white and the default text is black. And for the dark theme the background is black, and the default text is white.
In the code I'm using the function SetConsoleTextAttribute to set the desired colors. The argument hConsole is a reference or handle to the console so I can change the background and text colors.
